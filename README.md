# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> Barely set foot in the dungeon and already feeling overwhelmed? Feel like giving up? Need a quick pick-me-up? Running on empty and think you're fading fast? All of us - no matter if youre a warrior, a wizard, an archer, a priest, or just you - could use a little motivation from time to time. My site is here to offer you a little boost of confidence and support for whatever you're going through, adventurer! Sometimes, all we need is a little push - and I've got just the thing to help with that! Cycle through a list of affirmations and mantas to help give you that little bit of a confidence boost you need to push through that dungeon, or to let you know it's ok to take a break. After all, all heroes need to rest now and then.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> Go to github, fork, and clone it down. After that, CD into the project and open the index file! Thats it!

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (I hope this screenshot works)

Behold! A default dark mode with an "Even Darker" mode option available with the click of a button! Complete with buttons that glow only in the darkest mode!

### Context:
[//]: <> I am in mod 1, entering week 4. We've had from Tuesday afternoon until Sunday afternoon to get it done.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> Just I this time around. https://github.com/Virulencies/self-care-center

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> The learning goals were to be able to apply the culmination of the JS, HTML, and CSS knowledge we;ve learned so far to individually create a functioning webpage that offers affirmations and at least one other technical feature.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> Generating matching defeatist to triumphant chibi art to use via AI was the first "win" step. Getting the buttons and affirmations to line up under the images was the first technical hurdle I managed to clear. Lastly, getting the glow effect to work the way I wanted it to (only visible in darkest mode) took longer than I would have liked.
